# nodeQRCode

# This is the basic and beginner level qrcode generator which I learned and tried!!!!

1.Firstly clone the repo and then do `npm install`.
2.As you can see there are three different files each has its purpose.

3.When you run `node qrcodeImage.js` this give you the output in the console showing `data`. Copy that whole data and create a .html file in the same project and 
paste that data. Once you run the html file it will open in browser and QR code scanner will be shown.

4.When you run `node qrcode.console.js` it will show the QR Code in the console.Once you scan that you will see google website link. As I have kept that only.

5.When you run `node qrcode.url.js` it will create a qrcode png image for you in the same folder.

That's it.
